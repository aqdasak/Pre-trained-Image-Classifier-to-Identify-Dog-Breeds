# Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

In this project, you will use a *created* image classifier to identify dog breeds. 

### Project Goal: Image Classification for a City Dog Show

Your city is hosting a citywide dog show and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information.

Some people are planning on registering pets that **arenâ€™t actual dogs**.

You need to use an already developed Python classifier to make sure the participants are dogs.

### **Your Tasks:**

- Using your Python skills, you will determine which image classification algorithm works the "best" on classifying images as "dogs" or "*not* dogs".
- Determine how well the "best" classification algorithm works on correctly dentifying a dog's breed.
- Time how long each algorithm takes to solve the classification problem. With computational tasks, there is often a trade-off between accuracy and runtime. The more accurate an algorithm, the higher the likelihood that it will take more time to run and use more computational resources to run.

### **Important Notes:**

CNNs work particularly well for detecting features in images like colors, textures, and edges; then using these features to identify objects in the images. You'll use a CNN that as already *learned* the features from a giant dataset of 1.2 million images called [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/). There are different types of CNNs that have different structures (architectures) that work better or worse depending on your criteria. With this project, you'll explore the three different architectures (**AlexNet**, **VGG**, and **ResNet**) and determine which is best for your application.
